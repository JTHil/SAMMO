If nothing relevant shows up, please do [open a new issue](https://github.com/microsoft/sammo/issues/new) and provide as much detail as you can (ie: OS, python version, data formats, etc).

## Setting up your dev environment

1.  Instructions for installing in venv/conda here
1.  Install the pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install`.

    We use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) project to manage commit hooks. The configuration for **pre-commit** is stored in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. By default, our pre-commit hooks run the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formatter and check odds-and-ends like line endings (must be LF only).
